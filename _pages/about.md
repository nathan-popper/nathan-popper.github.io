Welcome to my website! I'm Nathan, a current graduate student at Georgia Tech studying data science. With nearly two enriching years dedicated to public health data and analytics, I've cultivated a profound appreciation for the transformative power of data-driven insights. 

Here on my personal website, I hope to present a collection of my projects that showcase my analytical and creative style of work. In addition, you'll be able to see my academic and professional journey to becoming a data scientist. 

### Check out my most recent project:

## Test

```python
def code_func():
x = 2
return x
```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">Let's see some code!</summary>

  ```python
    print('Hello World!')
  ```
  Of course, it has to be Hello World, right?
</details>

{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
